## Chat rules

- The user should be able to send private messages to users that he/she is following
- The user that the message was sent to, will receive the message instantly, if he/she is following the user that sent the message (shown under "Users You Are Following:") or if the user has a public profile (shown under "Other Users:")
- if the user is not following the user that sent the message and if the user doesn't have a public profile, the message is stored the database, and it will be shown when he/she starts following the user that sent the message or if the user switches his/her profile to public 
- If a public user switch his/her profile back to private, he/she can still continue on the existing conversations (even if he/she didn't send any messages)
- Groups should have a common chat room, so if a user is a member of the group he/she should be able to send and receive messages to this group chat.
